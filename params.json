{"name":"Bootstrap-extensions","tagline":"Some CSS classes which extend Twitter Bootstrap.","body":"Bootstrap Extensions\r\n====================\r\n\r\nSome CSS classes which extend [Bootstrap][bootstrap].\r\n\r\n  [bootstrap]: https://twitter.github.com/bootstrap\r\n\r\nConventions\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nFollowing the Bootstrap conventions, all extension classes are named upon their _base_ class name. In order to avoid any conflict in the future, I also prepend our custom classes names with `custom`.\r\n\r\n**Example**: `.custom-form-actions-bordered` extends `.form-actions` and should be used as follow:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n<div class=\"form-actions custom-form-actions-bordered\"> ... </div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\nSome of these extensions were crafted during my work time at [Acid Labs][acidlabs]. Thanks for that!\r\n\r\n  [acidlabs]: https://github.com/acidlabs\r\n\r\nContribute\r\n----------\r\n\r\nYou want to contribute with your custom classes, your testing knowledge or anything else?
